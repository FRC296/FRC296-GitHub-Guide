## This Repository
* Contains workshop material (found in [the wiki](https://github.com/FRC296/FRC296-Workshops/wiki) of this repository)
* Gives a quick introduction to Team 296's GitHub page and its content

## Organization Page Overview
* In the FRC296 organization page, you can find the following:
 1. Repositories of old and current projects, including
    * Past robots
    * Our Scouting Application
 2. Guides and Resources for all things programming
    * Check out the [**Wiki**](https://github.com/FRC296/FRC296-GitHub-Guide/wiki)!

## Looking Ahead
* Ideally, all software projects should be pushed to this organization page, with the objectives being:
  * Provide resources for future students
  * Act as a reference for current students looking for ideas, help, etc.
  * Act as an open-source reference for other teams
